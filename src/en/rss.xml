      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="about-minetest-education" tabindex="-1"> About <strong>Minetest:Education</strong></h2>
<p>This project started from my own child's education. In 2020, I came across &quot;<a href="https://education.minecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft: Education Edition</a>&quot; and initially thought it was a good option, However, I soon found out that as an individual user, I could only use it a limited number of times. The full &quot;Minecraft: Education Edition&quot; is designed specifically for schools only(which often have larger budgets) and is currently used in more than 115 countries/regions worldwide. It is a monthly subscription service that requires Microsoft 365 educational accounts and Mojang accounts, so access is limited unless the school allows it, making it inaccessible for ordinary people. This clearly does not align with the principle of everyone having the right to education.</p>
<p>During the trial period, I noticed that if a child played alone without any company, they would not follow the course content and instead play around aimlessly in the game world. They would prefer not to think and engage in mindless play, like digging holes, getting lost, climbing to high places, and jumping off, calling it &quot;bungee jumping.&quot; This kind of aimless play could go on endlessly.</p>
<p>So, the idea of using &quot;Minecraft: Education Edition&quot; for learning didn't work out.</p>
<p>Later, I discovered the open-source &quot;<a href="https://minetest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minetest voxel game engine</a>,&quot; which was even more open and free. Having learned my lesson from &quot;Minecraft: Education Edition,&quot; I developed the <a href="/en/guide/mods/quiz/">Quiz</a> player challenge mod first to implement periodic exercises during gameplay and to control the gameplay time. Even when playing foolishly, we still need to practice! Surprisingly, it worked well. Of course, my child still complained and demanded that I remove the practice exercises. So, I gave her a choice between practicing alone or practicing while playing the game, and she immediately chose the latter option without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The learning effect is quite well. Words that are usually hard to remember become easier when learned through the game. My child can remember them naturally and doesn't need me to supervise her. In the game, I gave her math and English questions. At first, the math questions were fixed and unchanging. After a day or two, she remembered the answers and stopped calculating. So, I had to change the questions frequently and even added the &quot;four basic arithmetic operations&quot; question type, which randomly generates questions based on a set of rules.</p>
<p>Afterward, to facilitate game content management, I directly modified the interface of Minetest by separating the student game interface (gameplay) from the teacher interface (manage game content). Then, I gave it a Chinese name &quot;莽兜&quot; which is a transliteration of Minetest. The game is filled with square blocks, and the name &quot;莽兜&quot; is a loose translation that fits well. After integrating several educational mods, &quot;Minetest: Education Edition&quot; was born.</p>
<p>Nowadays, whenever I have free time, I teach my child programming in &quot;Minetest World.&quot; As long as she can complete the tasks I assign in the game, she can play recklessly and do whatever she wants afterward. To be honest, although she has learned some programming skills, she still struggles to apply them. Even though she understands that programming can be used to quickly create a room, she still prefers to build it block by block with her own hands. She also knows that doors can be automatically opened and closed using pressure plates (player detectors), but she still likes to open and close them manually. Nonetheless, learning and experimenting in the game is more engaging than real life, and she has to keep practicing if she wants to continue playing.</p>
<p>Subsequently, our relatives and friends became interested in trying it out, and eventually, it evolved into an open-source project that we publicly released, hoping to help more people.</p>
<p>However, I must emphasize that if you don't have the time and energy, it's not advisable to force your child to learn through this game. It's not realistic to expect young children to have enough self-control to use it effectively, at least not in my experience. If you do want to try it, parents must be willing to invest more time and effort into the project, designing the curriculum within the game world, preparing suitable questions for their child, and playing together with them.</p>
<p>The source code repository for &quot;Minetest: Education Edition&quot; is located on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/edu-minetest/minetest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/edu-minetest/minetest/</a>. The main UI branch is edu/builtin, and a series of sub-functional branches prefixed with edu/ make up the rest of the project.</p>
<h2 id="about-minetest-voxel-game-engine" tabindex="-1"> About <a href="https://minetest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minetest Voxel Game Engine</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://minetest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minetest voxel game engine</a><sup></sup>, there wouldn't be the &quot;Minetest: Education Edition&quot; without it.</p>
<p>&quot;Minetest&quot; is a free and open-source sandbox game engine developed by a team of volunteers. It is written in C++ and can run on various systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Android. Minetest provides developers with an application programming interface (API) using Lua, allowing them to create their own games and mods.</p>
<p>Minetest has been used in educational environments to teach subjects such as mathematics, programming, and earth science. Compared to similar programs or packages, its advantages include zero cost and the ability to be deployed at scale in classrooms or research environments. Additionally, even though Minetest's graphics engine is not optimized for the latest hardware, it performs well on low-cost and low-end hardware<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>Here are some specific examples of how Minetest has been used in education:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minetest has been used as an aid in design and for remote teaching<sup></sup>.</li>
<li>Minetest has been used to teach logic and debugging skills to primary and secondary school students<sup></sup>.</li>
<li>Minetest has been utilized for teaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calculus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigonometry</a><sup></sup>.</li>
<li>In the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil, MineScratch (a variant of Minetest) has been used for teaching purposes<sup></sup>.</li>
<li>In Paris Descartes University, Minetest has been used to teach life and earth science to sixth-grade students who cannot observe certain phenomena in person but can experience them in the virtual world of Minetest<sup></sup>.</li>

<li>But the mod can only be set by directly modifying the configuration file
<ul>
<li>You cannot see the installed modules on the interface. To manage modules on the interface, you must first copy the modules to the <code>~/.minetest/</code> directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The built-in CSM module cannot be loaded directly, it must be copied to the <code>~/.minetest/</code> directory too.</li>

<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>This branch (<code>Release</code>) is created for releases only.</p>
</div>
<p>To be honest, I don't want to create an independent minetest version. In order to be able to merge back to the main branch at any time, I use an independent function branch for development.
The main function branch of <code>Minetest:Edu</code> is: <code>edu/builtin</code>, and a series of sub-function branches starting with <code>edu/</code>.</p>
<p>Branch description:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>edu/builtin</code>: Add student interface and teacher interface</li>
<li><code>edu/settings/binary</code>: Add support for binary configuration files</li>
<li><code>edu/drawHeader</code>: fix drawHeader</li>
<li><code>edu/static_spawnpoint</code>: fix spawn point issue</li>
<li><code>edu/android/client-translation</code>: fix android default Chinese problem</li>
<li><code>feat/singleplayer-user</code>: support multi-player in single player game</li>
<li><code>fix/trusted_mod_io</code>: This security patch determines a function's access rights by checking which mod ultimately initiated the execution of the script function.
<ul>
<li>Note: You should disable Lua's tail call optimization to address the issue of Lua call stack information being lost.</li>
<li>Here is my code to <a href="https://github.com/edu-minetest/LuaJIT/tree/feat/tailcall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disable Lua's tail call optimization</a></li>
<li>When a regular mod calls a function of a trusted mod, the privilege should not be elevated.</li>
<li>When a trusted mod calls a function of a regular mod, the privilege should not downgrade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>rubenwardy-world_independent_common_data</code>: Modified from <a href="https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/12315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add world-independent storage directory for mods</a>
<ul>
<li><code>minetest.get_mod_data_path([mod_name])</code>: add optional <code>mod_name</code> argument.</li>
<li>add <code>minetest.get_mod_data_path(mod_name)</code> to <code>mainmenu</code></li>
<li>add <code>minetest.get_mod_data_path([mod_name])</code> to <code>client(CSM)</code></li>
<li>The <code>mod_data/[mod_name]/</code> directory is typically writable by its mod owner and readable by others.</li>
<li>already merged the <code>fix/trusted_mod_io</code> branch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>feat/csm-check_is_single_player</code>: add <code>is_single_player</code> boolean field to the <code>get_server_info()</code> client(CSM) api</li>
<li><code>feat/csm-client_ready_etc</code>: add register_on_client_ready, register_on_camera_ready and register_on_minimap_ready callback registration to the client(CSM) api</li>
<li><code>feature/add-unregister-function</code>: add an unregister function that is returned by global callback registration functions in LUA.</li>

<p><img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/mobile-student-cn.webp" alt="stu-play" /></p>
<p>Then click the &quot;Start (Single Player) Game&quot; button to enter the game.</p>
<div>
<p>multiplayer game</p>
<p>Appears only after enabling multiplayer in &quot;Teacher Mode&quot; and configuring the server address.</p>
</div>
<p>After entering the game, the operation method is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/minetest_android_keys.webp" alt="minetest_android_keys" /></p>
<p>The game world is made up of different kinds of &quot;blocks&quot;. All blocks in the game world can be dug out (destroyed), and of course you can place &quot;blocks&quot; anywhere.</p>
<p>Basic operation of the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>First-person character walking operation</li>
<li>Dig out (destroy) and place the &quot;block&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>The game operation on the mobile phone is different from the computer operation. The mobile phone is a touch screen operation, and the touch screen operation is divided into left and right sides from the middle.</p>
<h3 id="screen-left" tabindex="-1"> Screen Left</h3>
<p>Pushing and pulling at any position on the left is to control the character's walking direction control area (<strong>movement direction control</strong> virtual button<img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/direction.png" alt="Diection" />) and <strong>function menu</strong> buttons (three Vertical dots<img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/three-dot.png" alt="three dot" />).</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Function Menu</strong> on the left (three vertical dots) <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/three-dot.png" alt="three dot" />:

<li>Chest drop icon <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/drop.png" alt="Drop" /> - Click to drop the item the player is holding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="screen-right" tabindex="-1"> Screen Right</h3>
<p>On the right is the operating area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch the screen and swipe around to adjust the line of sight for the character to rotate in place (look around)</li>
<li>Press and hold the nearby square (object) on the screen to <strong>dig (drop the square)</strong> or <strong>click</strong>, which is equivalent to the left mouse button on the computer</li>
<li>Double-clicking (twice in a row) the items on the screen (also all blocks) is an interactive operation (such as: placing the block in the hand, opening the door), which is equivalent to the right mouse button on the computer</li>
</ul>
<p>The other buttons are explained as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Configuration Menu</strong> <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/gear.png" alt="gear" />, you can see the following buttons:
<ul>
<li>Binocular icon <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/binocular.png" alt="Binocular" /> - toggle field of view</li>
<li>The eye icon <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/eye.png" alt="Eye" /> - toggles player view</li>

<li>Paper airplane icon <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/fly.png" alt="Fly" /> - enable/disable flight mode (requires &quot;fly&quot; privilege)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Depends on the game</li>
<li><strong>Auxiliary Key</strong>(Aux1): Depends on the game.</li>
<li><strong>Up<img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/up.png" alt="up" />Down<img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/down.png" alt="down" />Control</strong>: Use for climbing ladders, swimming, flying, etc.

<li>nether: The nether mod adds an underground abyss that you can enter through obsidian portals. There are different map generation methods in the Abyss.
<ul>
<li>You can reach a huge lava sea by finding rare passages in nether rocks.</li>
<li>Nether portals are vertical rectangular frames made of obsidian, 4 blocks wide and 5 blocks high. After the construction is complete, you can right-click and use the Mese crystal shard to activate the portal.</li>

<li>steampunk_blimp
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/steampunk_blimp.jpg" alt="steampunk_blimp" width="468" /></li>
<li>This mod implements a fantasy steampunk hot air balloon airship that can be used in the Minetest game. This mod was made for fun, but it tries to provide an immersive operating experience. It can carry 7 players.</li>
<li>To fly, some items need to be provided, such as fuel and boiler water. Fuel can be coal, briquettes and wood. On the balloon, provide fuel and water by tapping on the desired item. There is another way to add water to the boiler: if the balloon lands on water, water can be loaded through the menu. But the current pressure will be lost.</li>
<li>Activate the stove in the first option of the menu. Take control of the balloon by activating the option &quot;Take control&quot;.</li>
<li>Information panels will be displayed on the left and bottom of the screen. Wait for the boiler to reach the proper operating pressure (green) before operating the power lever. Press the jump key (space bar) to fly upwards. Note that it takes some pressure out of the boiler. Hold down the sneak key (Shift key) to fly down.</li>
<li>Increase propeller power forward, decrease backward. To reverse, press and hold the assist key (E key) and the back key at the same time. There is a power mode. When the lever is at its upper limit, hold E and the forward key to increase the acceleration. But be aware that the boiler will lose pressure.</li>
<li>Balloon inventory can be accessed via Aux(E) + right click.</li>
<li>Share owner:
<ul>
<li>This car is designed for group sharing. So the owner can set more users to operate it. Inside the balloon, just use the command <code>/blimp_share &lt;name&gt;</code> to share. To remove someone from a share, use <code>/blimp_remove &lt;name&gt;</code>. To list owners, use <code>/blimp_list</code>. Balloon access can be locked so that only the owner can enter: <code>/blimp_lock true</code>. Anyone can enter, <code>/blimp_lock false</code>. All shared owners have access to balloon inventory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Airship appearance painting:
<ul>
<li>As with the plane, hit the hull with the dye and the main color will change.</li>
<li>To change the secondary color, hold down the Modifier (E) key, then thrash with the dye.</li>
<li>To set a logo on a balloon, enter the balloon and enter the command <code>/blimp_logo</code>.
*Only original owner may paint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hot key:
<ul>
<li>Right click to enter and access the menu</li>
<li>Painted by thrashing with dye</li>
<li>Forward and backward in the driving position: control the power lever</li>
<li>left and right in the driving position: control the direction</li>
<li>Jump and Sneak: Control to move up and down</li>
<li>E + right click to enter: access inventory</li>
<li>In driving position E+backwards: the machine drives backwards</li>
<li>In driving position E+forward: extra power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hint:
<ul>
<li>Be careful driving it.</li>
<li>The captain can leave the driving position to walk around.</li>
<li>If a player times out or exits in flight, the balloon will &quot;rescue&quot; him if no other players enter the balloon, so it's best to wait for a friend in a safe place away from anyone trying to enter the balloon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>Walking inside a boat is affected by server latency, because the add-on function does not have an interpolation method.</li>
<li>The rubber band bug issue is inherently a problem with Minetest and can be fixed by simply closing and reopening Minetest. Or try to live Michael Jackson's life and learn the proper Moonwalk XD</li>
<li>Some older versions of Minetest may have weird issues with the camera being set to the center of the map. If this happens, type <code>/blimp_eject</code> to move freely again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tone_bells: Added a new type of block called &quot;tone bells&quot;. Tone Clocks can play musical notes like musical note blocks. Unlike note blocks, you can select notes by stacking tone bells of different colors.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/tone_bells.jpg" alt="tone_bells" width="468" /></li>
<li>The tone clock has 4 colors. There is an initial note in it. Each pitch bell raises the pitch of the resulting note by a certain amount.</li>
<li>Gray tone bells do not change the pitch of the resulting note. They can be used to play starting notes and to make tone bells in the other three colors.</li>
<li>The red tone bell slightly raises the pitch of the resulting note.</li>
<li>Blue tone bells will dramatically raise the pitch of the resulting note.</li>
<li>The yellow tone bell will raise the pitch of the resulting note very slightly.</li>
<li>Stacking tone bells together can create different notes. To play a note, just tap the stacked bell. You can also use mesecons to activate tonal bells, allowing you to play multiple notes simultaneously to form chords.</li>
<li>Try to explore what kind of melodies you can make!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>wine allows players to ferment different foods into delicious drinking wine, depending on other mods you have enabled. For example, if the Farming Redo mod is enabled, you can ferment grapes into wine, etc., if the Mobs Animals mod is enabled, you can ferment honey into mead, and if the MineClone2 mod is enabled, you can ferment wheat into Beer and more.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/wine.jpg" alt="wine" width="468" /></li>
<li>By placing 9 drink cups in the crafting slot, they can be crafted into wine bottles. Drink glasses and wine bottles can be placed as decorations. A Wine Barrel can be crafted by adding a row of Wood and two Steel Ingots to the crafting bar.</li>
<li>Hover over a keg to see progress info, or hover over the keg icon inside a keg to see what's brewing.
*Many other foods can also be used to ferment different kinds of alcoholic beverages. If used with the author's Stamina mod, the player will appear drunk when you drink too much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advtrains: Advanced Trains (Advanced Train) is a module for train simulation. Its main feature is to provide realistic trains and various railway equipment, with an emphasis on automatic train operation.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/advtrains.jpg" alt="advtrains" width="468" /></li>
<li>Almost realistic track system, including curves and switches.</li>
<li>Railway signaling system, which can be controlled in various ways.</li>
<li>ATC (Automatic Train Control) System: Simple command-based automatic train control.</li>
<li>LuaATC (Lua script-based automatic train control) system: a powerful automatic train operating system (needs certain programming knowledge).</li>
<li>Interlocking (interlocking) system, including track segmentation, routing and automatic stop before the signal and other functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advtrains_portable_remote_control: Provides a rebindable remote controller for the advtrains train mod.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/advtrains_portable_remote_control.jpg" alt="advtrains_portable_remote_control" width="468" /></li>
<li>Bind the train
<ul>
<li>Use the controller to left-click on the locomotive to bind the controller to the locomotive. Controllers will only be bound to specific locomotives, not the entire train, allowing control of the locomotive to be maintained while shunting, even though the train ID may change.</li>
<li>Please note: this controller can only be bound to locomotives, i.e. entities that have <code>is_locomotive = true</code> in the advtrains registration definition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rebind the train
<ul>
<li>To rebind the controller to another locomotive, just click the &quot;Bind to New Train&quot; button. Saved locomotives are wiped from memory in preparation for rebinding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>train information
<ul>
<li>When the user uses the controller, the <code>External Display</code>, <code>Internal Display</code>, <code>Routing Code</code> and <code>Line</code> fields will be read from the bound train. If these fields are changed between the time these fields are read from the train and the user clicks &quot;Update Train Info&quot;, the changes will be written to the train, overwriting any changes the train may have accumulated in the meantime (e.g. via station tracks Changed internal display text).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Train control
<ul>
<li>When the user uses the controller, the <code>Set Speed</code> field will also read from the train, but it will read the actual speed of the train at that moment. The speed is sent to the train only when the &quot;Confirm&quot; button is clicked.</li>
<li>The <code>Send ATC</code> field does exactly the same thing as a train traveling on an ATC track and following the direction of the arrow. Users can use this feature to pre-program maneuvers without having to keep returning to the controller. For the commands and syntax of the ATC controller, see the <a href="https://advtrains.de/wiki/doku.php?id=usage:nodes:atc_controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATC controller's documentation</a>. When you click send, the command is sent to the train immediately and is not held in memory during controller use.</li>
<li><code>Disable ARS</code> and <code>Autocouple</code> checkboxes will also be read from the train when the user is using the controller. If the train has been set to couple via the <code>Cpl</code> ATC command or the <code>set_autocouple()</code> LuaATC command, the <code>Autocouple</code> checkbox will appear checked. Manually checking the checkbox has the same effect as <code>set_autocouple()</code>. <code>Disable ARS</code> needs to enable <code>advtrains_interlocking</code> sub-module to take effect, its effect is equivalent to <code>A</code> ATC command and <code>atc_set_ars_disable()</code> LuaATC command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permission requirements
<ul>
<li>Since the train can be controlled from anywhere on the server, <code>train_admin</code> permission is required to use this tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advtrains_custom: Added <code>advtrains_custom.max_range</code> parameter for advtrains module
<ul>
<li>It allows the player to control the maximum range of the train. Specifically, this parameter controls in which zones trains can be activated and run.</li>
<li>By default, trains will only be activated and run within a certain radius around the player. This is to avoid too many trains occupying server resources, so as to maintain the smoothness of the game. In the advtrains mod, this range is usually 500 nodes. This means that if the player is more than 500 nodes away from the train, the train will be suspended until the player gets closer again.</li>
<li>Players can increase or decrease this range by adjusting the advtrains_custom.max_range parameter. For example, setting this parameter to 1000 will make the train run in a larger area, while setting this parameter to 250 will make the train run only in a smaller area. However, please note that if the range is set too large, it may cause excessive occupation of server resources, thereby affecting the fluency of the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>appliances</li>
<li>calendar_node</li>
<li>compactor</li>
<li>decoshelves</li>
<li>draconis: Added huge and terrifying dragons and powerful dragon scale steel equipment.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/draconis.jpg" alt="draconis" width="468" /></li>
<li>Dragons are huge flying beasts with powerful breaths capable of destroying almost anything.</li>
<li>Dragon eggs are rare and valuable drops from old dragons. Place a dragon egg in a 3x3 bonepile nest and the dragon egg will &quot;wake up&quot; and you can set it on fire or drown it to start hatching.</li>
<li>Dragonscale steel can be used to craft tools and armor (if the 3d armor mod is enabled), they far outperform diamonds. Dragonscale steel is expensive, time-consuming, and cannot be stacked. Each ingot is directly tied to the dragon that forged it, and ingots forged by different individual dragons cannot be mixed for crafting. Dragonscale steel tools gain power from the dragon they are attached to, with attack power and speed increasing the closer the tool is to the dragon. Instead, if the dragon dies, the tool will shatter when used.</li>

<li>farming: Farming Redo mod, which comes with many new crops that spawn throughout the map. New food only needs to be planted on top of plowed soil, so no seeds are needed. Primitive wheat and cotton require seeds, which can be found in normal and jungle grass. Crops can even grow while the player is away, or if you want quick access to food, the Bonemeal mod can help speed up the growth of your favorite dishes.

<p>If there is no configuration, the system defaults to running the game with damage enabled [Creative Mode] (./creative/).</p>
</div>
<p>If the child is relatively young (&lt;10 years old), it is recommended to start with [creative mode] (./creative/) and do not enable damage. If your child is adventurous, try <a href="/en/guide/play/survival/">Survival Mode</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/en/guide/play/survival/">Survival Mode</a> can help younger children understand why houses, torches and myths and legends were needed in the Stone Age.</p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>How to enable <a href="/en/guide/play/survival/">Survival Mode</a> and disable damage, please refer to &quot;<a href="/en/guide/teacher/">Parent/Teacher Guide</a>&quot;.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The minetest game world is a giant cube. Because of this, a location in the world can easily be represented in Cartesian coordinates. That is, for every location in the world, it can be represented by: X, Y, and Z.</p>
<h2 id="expression" tabindex="-1"> Expression</h2>
<p>The coordinates are represented as follows: <code>(5, 45, -12)</code></p>
<p>This refers to the position of X=5, Y=45, Z=-12. These three letters are called &quot;axis&quot;: Y stands for height. X and Z are for horizontal position.</p>
<div>
<p>World borders</p>
<p><a href="./coordinates">X,Y,Z</a> maximum <a href="./coordinates">coordinates</a> values are: −30912 to 30927 = 61840</p>
<p>The space size is <code>61840x61840x61840</code>, if a square is 1 cubic meter, then it is 2.36487637504×10<sup>14</sup> cubic meters.
Maximum area: 61840x61840 = 3,824,185,600 m<sup>2</sup> ≈ 3824 square kilometers (about half the size of Shanghai).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="direction" tabindex="-1"> Direction</h2>
<p>The X, Y, and Z values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you go up, Y increases (Up)</li>
<li>If you go down, Y decreases (Down)</li>
<li>If you follow the sun, X will increase (East)</li>
<li>If you go in the opposite direction, X will decrease (West)</li>
<li>Look in the direction of the sun, then turn 90° left and walk forward: Z increases (North)</li>
<li>Look in the direction of the sun, then turn right 90° and walk forward: Z decreases (South)</li>
<li>The side length of a complete square is: 1</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/xyz.gif" alt="XYZ" /></p>
<h2 id="view-your-coordinates-debug-screen" tabindex="-1"> View your coordinates (debug screen)</h2>
<p>You can view your coordinates by opening the debug screen (press <code>F5</code> to open), the top of the screen displays the debug information, and the number after <code>Pos:</code> on the second line is your coordinates.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/your_coordinate.jpg" alt="your_coordinate" /></p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/debug_screen.jpg" alt="debug screen" /></p>
<p>Normally the game/server allows this, or you have &quot;<code>debug</code>&quot; permissions.</p>
<p>By default the game does give you access to the coordinates in the debug screen, so that works most of the time.</p>
<p>But some games may choose to hide the coordinates in the debug screen from normal players. Maybe you should &quot;earn&quot; the right to see the coordinates (like using a special item), or maybe the coordinates are hidden entirely to make the game more difficult. However, if you have &quot;debug&quot; privilege, you are guaranteed access.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In-game via chat commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can manage players and player permissions;</li>
<li>Many mods can also be managed in-game by providing new chat commands and new permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>To use chat commands for management, you must first obtain the corresponding permissions</p>
<h2 id="chat-command" tabindex="-1"> Chat command</h2>
<p>In-game management is carried out through <code>chat commands</code> (also known as <code>server commands</code>). As the name implies, <code>chat commands</code> are entered in the chat window, for example, you can use the <code>/privs</code> command to view your own permissions.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, the commands in this article assume that no privileges are required.</p>
<h3 id="send-command" tabindex="-1"> Send command</h3>
<p>To send commands in the game, you only need to open the chat window and type commands like other chat messages. Any player can enter commands through chat to perform certain operations.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Some commands only work if you have granted the user <code>privileges</code> on the server.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>How to open the chat form</p>
<Tabs :data='[{"title":"PC/Computer","value":"pc"},{"title":"Android Phone/Tablet","value":"mobile"}]' tab-id="operator">
<template #tab0="{ title, value, isActive }">
<ul>
<li>Press <code>T</code> : Open the chat window, finish typing, press <code>Enter</code> key to send, <code>ESC</code> to cancel.</li>
<li>Press <code>/</code> : Open the chat window, where the <code>/</code> character has been typed for you, you can directly enter the chat command, press the <code>Enter</code> key to send, <code>ESC</code> to cancel.</li>
</ul>
</template>
<template #tab1="{ title, value, isActive }">
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Function Menu</strong> on the left (three vertical dots) <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/three-dot.png" alt="three dot" />:
<ul>
<li>Click on the <code>Chat Bubble</code> icon <img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/chat.png" alt="chat" /> - open the chat window, then when finished typing, press <code>Enter</code> to send.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/get-started/imgs/minetest_android_keys.webp" alt="minetest_android" /></p>
</template>
</Tabs>
</div>
<p>All commands start with &quot;<code>/</code>&quot;. After that, a word (command) follows, followed by parameters. The number of parameters depends on the specific command, but there are conventions: the parameters in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> indicate necessary parameters, and the parameters in <code>[]</code> indicate that they can be omitted.</p>
<div>
<p>All commands start with "`/`" character</p>
<p>So normal chat messages cannot start with &quot;<code>/</code>&quot;, they will be interpreted as commands even if such commands don't exist.</p>
<p>You can tell whether the command was successful by the server's response. If you see <code>Invalid command: /blargh</code> in chat, you may have misspelled the command.
If the command is executed successfully, the command will return the result in the chat history or display the form.</p>
</div>
<p>As an administrator, you also have no special permissions at the beginning, but you can obtain all permissions at any time by executing the <code>/grantme all</code> command to facilitate subsequent operations.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-privileges" tabindex="-1"> built-in privileges</h2>
<div>
<p>show all privileges</p>
<p>All privileges (including those added by the mod) can be obtained through the chat command <code>/help privs</code></p>

<h3 id="grant-revoke-privileges-command" tabindex="-1"> Grant/revoke privileges command</h3>
<p>All of these commands require you to have &quot;<code>privs</code>&quot; (manipulate all privileges) or &quot;<code>basic_privs</code>&quot; (manipulate &quot;<code>interact</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>shout</code>&quot; privileges) privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/grant &lt;player&gt; &lt;privilege&gt;</code> - grant <code>&lt;privilege&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;player&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>/grant &lt;player&gt; all</code> — grant all available privileges to <code>&lt;player&gt;</code></li>

<ul>
<li><code>/msg &lt;player&gt; &lt;message&gt;</code>: Send a direct message <code>&lt;message&gt;</code> to the specified player <code>&lt;player&gt;</code>; other players cannot see it.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The message sent by <code>/msg</code> isn't really a secret. Anyone intercepting network traffic, server operators can in principle still read</p>
</div>
<h3 id="items" tabindex="-1"> Items</h3>
<h4 id="give-和-giveme-give-item-command" tabindex="-1"> <code>/give</code> 和 <code>/giveme</code> give item command</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>/give &lt;player&gt; &lt;itemstring&gt; [&lt;count&gt; [&lt;wear&gt;]]</code>: Give the player <code>&lt;player&gt;</code> the specified number of <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> (default is 1) items <code>&lt;itemstring&gt;</code>( Refer to <a href="./item-string">ItemStrings</a>). The <code>&lt;wear&gt;</code> parameter is the damage degree of the specified tool (0-65535, the larger the value, the greater the damage, the default value is 0), if it is other items, this value is useless , requires the &quot;give&quot; privilege.</li>
<li><code>/giveme &lt;itemstring&gt; [&lt;count&gt; [&lt;wear&gt;]]</code>: Give me something. <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;wear&gt;</code> have the same meaning as <code>/give</code>. The &quot;give&quot; privilege is required.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Executing this command requires the &quot;<code>give</code>&quot; privilege</p>
</div>
<p>example</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/giveme default:torch</code>: give you a torch</li>
<li><code>/give Peter default:cobble 50</code>: Give player: <code>Peter</code> 50 cobblestones</li>
<li><code>/giveme default:pick_steel 1 16383</code>: Gives you an iron pickaxe with about 25% wear</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>Negative numbers for <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;wear&gt;</code> will count down from 65536, so you can use -1 as a shorthand for 65535 (the maximum possible value).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="teleport-command" tabindex="-1"> Teleport command</h3>
<p>Teleportation is the immediate movement of any player to a given location. All of the following commands require the &quot;<code>teleport</code>&quot; privilege</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="banned-or-kicked-player-from-server" tabindex="-1"> Banned or kicked player from server</h3>

<li><code>World Name</code>: <strong>required</strong>, give the newly created world a name, it will be used as the folder name of the world, and placed in the <code>worlds</code> directory.</li>
<li><code>Seed</code>: <strong>Optional</strong>, if not filled in, a seed value will be randomly generated automatically, the same seed and the same map generator will generate the same world.</li>
<li><code>Map Generator</code>: <strong>required</strong>, in addition to controlling the appearance of the map terrain and generating building structures, the map generator (Map Generator) will also have an ecosystem (biological community). In addition to <code>v6</code> In all map generators except , these ecosystems (biomes) can be defined by mods using the <code>Biome API</code>, in other words, enabled features mods may drastically alter them. The <code>v6</code> map generator is special in that its biomes are completely predefined and cannot be easily changed.</li>

<p>Important Hint</p>
<p><code>v5</code> and <code>v6</code> are not legacy map generators. &quot;<code>v5</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>v6</code>&quot;, and &quot;<code>v7</code>&quot; are names, not version numbers. All map generators (mapgen) included in Minetest are officially supported and updated.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>v5</code> map generator: Although it emphasizes authenticity, v5 sometimes runs out of extreme terrain, such as super deep sea and super deep caves. unrealistic but interesting landscapes, often with floating specks and extreme terrain overhangs,
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/mapgen_v5.jpg" alt="mapgen_v5" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>v6</code> map generator: simple hills, cliffs and plateaus, fairly flat and small-scale map generator, no terrain overhangs, pre-defined biomes, cannot be changed easily
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/mapgen_v6.jpg" alt="mapgen_v6" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>v7</code> map generator: It is the latest map generator of <code>Minetest 5.6</code>, with rich terrain, often with vast ecosystem terrain, very wide landscape, overhanging mountains and distant plains . Rivers appear at near sea level, can be customized by mods using the <code>Biome API</code>
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/v7map.jpg" alt="v7 map" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>carpathian</code> Carpathian Mountains map generator: complex and realistic mountains with many variants, sometimes reaching extremely high heights, separated by oceans and deep low plains
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/mapgen_carpathian.jpg" alt="mapgen_carpathian" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>valleys</code> valley map generator: In addition to generating general ecosystems and caves, it will also generate valleys and rivers. The shape of the mountain is more natural and tends to have different ecosystems depending on the altitude. Maps will often see high mountains and winding rivers. Interestingly, these rivers have height differences, and they will go down like real-world rivers. The special water block <code>river water</code> was also introduced for this purpose.
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/teacher/imgs/mapgen_valleys2.jpg" alt="mapgen_valleys" /></li>

<p>Decorations: Decorations are additional structures that modules place on top of surfaces. Ornaments can be small plants such as grass, flowers, cacti, or even entire trees or buildings.
The <code>v6 map generator</code> is an exception here, as normal trees, apple trees, jungle trees, pine trees, and jungle grass are generated by the map generator itself and are not considered decorations and thus are not affected by this setting.

<p>Tips</p>
<p>Before using this mod, remember to confirm that the mod has been enabled.</p>
</div>
<p>CodeBlock allows in-game lua code to build anything you want.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot" /></p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>Search for <code>code</code> in the item bar, you can find the <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/dp.png" alt="run" /> block and <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/ds.png" alt="write" /> block in creative mode (or have <code>give</code> permission) Click on the square to get it.
Currently, since there is no formula for making blocks, they can only be given by parents in survival mode.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/ds.png" alt="Writing" /> is the box for writing code, and the code editor can be opened by right-clicking on the mouse (double-clicking on the right operating area for Android).</p>
<p>For first time use, you can use the chat command <code>/codegenerate</code> to get some example code.</p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>How to send chat commands, please refer to &quot;<a href="/en/teacher/ingame-man/">In-Game Management: Send Commands</a>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/code-new.jpg" alt="code-new" /></p>
<p>Double-click on the file to open the corresponding code.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/code-edit.jpg" alt="code-edit" /></p>
<p>The last line added is to call the <code>line</code> function to draw a straight line with a length of 12 &quot;meters&quot; (the length of a block is agreed to be one meter in the game world). The material of the line is not specified and is random.</p>
<p>Then click <code>Save</code> to save the code, then click <code>Load and Close</code> to load and close the editor.</p>
<p>The <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/dp.png" alt="Run" /> block is the run block, select the <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/dp.png" alt="Run" /> block, then go to the place you want to build and place (right mouse button) to run![Run](. /dp.png) box, and then hit (the left mouse button) the run! <a href="./dp.png">Run</a> box, you can.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>When placing the Run<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/codeblock/dp.png" alt="Run" /> block, the direction you are facing is the direction in which to run.</p>
</div>

</ul>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>Before using this mod, remember to enable this mod first.</p>
</div>
<p>This mod adds a block for exploring arithmetic with kids that bond together and change appearance based on the number of blocks connected, the mod was developed with the inspiration of the children's TV show <a href="https://www.learningblocks.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numberblocks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/numeracy/num-header.jpg" alt="num-header" /></p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>You can find the block by searching <code>numeracy</code> in the inventory, and you can get it by clicking on the block in creative mode (or with the <code>give</code> permission).
Currently, since there is no recipe for making this block, it can only be given by parents in survival mode.</p>
</div>
<p>Get &quot;Arithmetic Blocks&quot; from your inventory and start grouping them. Watch the appearance of the blocks change and the numbers above the blocks change.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/numeracy/numeracy-group.jpg" alt="numeracy-group" /></p>
<p>Try to measure the distance between two places by placing a chain of blocks.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/numeracy/numeracy-length.jpg" alt="numeracy-length" /></p>
<p>Measure the height.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/numeracy/numeracy-height.jpg" alt="numeracy-height" /></p>
<p>Try to make as many different rectangles or other shapes as possible with the same number of blocks.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/numeracy/numeracy-shape.jpg" alt="numeracy-shape" /></p>
<p>Try exploring natural number sequences, rectangles, squares, cubes, triangles (like stairs).</p>

<li><strong>Author</strong>: Minetest:Education(Riceball LEE)</li>
</ul>
<p>In-game mods for game time management and interspersed practice between games.</p>
<p>When the specified <code>game time (minutes)</code> is up, the players in the game will be kicked out of the game, and the game can only be continued after the <code>break time (minutes)</code> is reached.
In the game, a question will be raised every time the <code>question interval (minutes)</code> time is reached. Players must answer correctly to continue the game. Players who answer correctly will get reward items.</p>
<p>To use this feature make sure the <code>quiz</code> and <code>quiz_ui</code> mods are enabled on the game world (course).</p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>The <code>quiz</code> permission is required to configure and manage the Quiz module, which can be given to oneself by the chat command: <code>/grantme quiz</code>.
Then execute the <code>/quiz</code> chat command to enter the management interface (note that the <code>quiz_ui</code> module must be enabled at the same time for this course).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>noquiz</code> permission for the specified player, so that the player does not need to answer the question: <code>/grant &lt;player&gt; noquiz</code>.</li>
<li>Revoke <code>noquiz</code> permission from player: <code>/revoke &lt;player&gt; noquiz</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>How to send chat commands, please refer to &quot;<a href="/en/guide/teacher/ingame-man/">In-Game Management: Send Commands</a>&quot;.</p>

<li><strong>Author</strong>: Nigel Garnett(nigel.garnett@gmail.com)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Nigel Garnett: VBots are single-block &quot;turtle&quot;-style robots that are completely visually programmed. They exist to entertain my 5 year old daughters and teach them the basics of computer programming without writing too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Command the turtle robot with graphical commands.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot" /></p>
<h2 id="basic-operation" tabindex="-1"> Basic operation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run the program by tapping an idle VBot with your free hand (or click the run icon in the menu [see below]).</li>
<li>Hit the running VBot (turtle robot) with bare hands to stop the program.</li>
<li>Right-click (double-tap on Android phones) to open the <code>Action Menu</code> (see below).</li>
<li>Hit it with anything other than an empty hand to dig a VBot (turtle robot), but remember that the robot can only be mined (returns the turtle to the inventory) when the VBot's inventory is empty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-menu" tabindex="-1"> Action menu</h2>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/doc_menu1.png" alt="menu1" /></p>
<p>The icons <code>commands</code><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_gui_commands.png" alt="commands" /> and <code>inventory</code><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_location_inventory.png" alt="inventory" /> are used to toggle between the 2 panels shown here.</p>
<p>The command pane above contains commands for the robot, which can be added to the current subroutine by simply clicking on them (red area on the right).</p>
<p>The lower panel shows the inventory list panel, with the bot's inventory list on top and the player's inventory list below. This panel is used to add things to the robot's inventory (so that it can build with them) or to remove things from the robot's inventory after digging.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/doc_menu2.png" alt="menu2" /></p>
<p>When the Trash<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_gui_trash.png" alt="trash" /> icon is pressed, delete the last command on the current subroutine page. Next to this icon is another 1x1 trash can slot, which acts as a trash can, and anything that falls into it is destroyed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_gui_run.png" alt="run" /> icon, like hitting the robot with an open hand, it will start the program</li>
<li>Save! The <a href="./vbots_gui_save.png">save</a> icon saves the current program and subroutines under the robot's name.</li>
<li>Load<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_gui_load.png" alt="load" /> icon allows you to select a program and load it into the robot. Also on this menu are icons that allow programs to be deleted and renamed.</li>
<li>The reset<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_gui_nuke.png" alt="reset" /> icon will clear the main program and all subroutines, but will not clear the robot's inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Subroutines panel (red on the right) has 7 pages. The <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_program_0.png" alt="lion" /> icon is the page of the &quot;main&quot; program, where execution starts when the robot is activated. The other 6 pages are subroutines, which can be invoked via the 6 &quot;run subroutine&quot; icons at the bottom of the command palette. <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_1.png" alt="Dinosaur" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_2.png" alt="Goat" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_3.png" alt="Horse" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_4.png" alt="Parrot" /> ![Bear](. /vbots_run_5.png) <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_6.png" alt="Rhino" /></p>
<h3 id="move" tabindex="-1"> Move</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_forward.png" alt="forward" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_backward.png" alt="backward" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_up.png" alt="up" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_down.png" alt="down" /> forward , to move the robot backwards, up or down. If the new location is not empty, the move will fail.</li>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_home.png" alt="home" /> moves the robot back to where it was placed. NOTE: The orientation of the robot will not return to its original orientation.</li>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_clockwise.png" alt="clockwise" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_anticlockwise.png" alt="anticlockwise" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_random.png" alt="random" /> These commands turn the robot in a clockwise, anticlockwise or random direction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="action" tabindex="-1"> Action</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_dig_up.png" alt="dig up" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_dig_down.png" alt="dig down" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_dig.png" alt="dig" /> These commands make the robot dig nodes in that direction, then move to where it digs. NOTE: Mining will fail if the node being mined has protection that the bot owner cannot mine.</li>
<li><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_build_up.png" alt="Build Up" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_build_up.png" alt="Build Down" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_build.png" alt="Build" /> These commands make the robot place a block at the specified location (if protected allowed and the location is empty). The node placed by the robot is the first thing found in the robot's inventory, starting with the first slot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special" tabindex="-1"> Special</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_mode_speed.png" alt="speed" /> This pseudo-command selects the speed at which the robot will run the program. When followed by a number multiplier, it makes the robot run many times faster. When there is no number after it, it resets the robot to normal speed.</p>
<h3 id="multiplier" tabindex="-1"> Multiplier</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_2.png" alt="x2" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_3.png" alt="x3" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_4.png" alt="x4" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_5.png" alt="x5" /> ![x6](. /vbots_number_6.png) <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_7.png" alt="x7" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_8.png" alt="x8" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_9.png" alt="x9" /> In addition to speed (as above), the multiplier Works the same for all commands. For all other commands (including call subroutine commands), they cause the command to run multiple times.</p>
<h3 id="example-1" tabindex="-1"> Example 1</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_forward.png" alt="forward" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_4.png" alt="x4" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_clockwise.png" alt="clockwise" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_2.png" alt="x2" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_forward.png" alt="forward " /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_4.png" alt="x4" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_clockwise.png" alt="clockwise" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_2.png" alt="x2" /></p>
<p>The program makes the robot move forward 4 spaces (if possible) then turn 180 degrees, move forward 4 spaces (i.e. back to the starting position) then turn 180 degrees again to face the original orientation.</p>
<h3 id="example-2" tabindex="-1"> Example 2</h3>
<p>Example 2 is actually Example 1 using subroutines.</p>
<p>In the dinosaur<img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_1.png" alt="dinosaur" /> subroutine put the following: <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_move_forward.png" alt="forward" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_4.png" alt="x4" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_turn_clockwise.png" alt="clockwise" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_2.png" alt="x2" /></p>
<p>Then, in the <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_program_0.png" alt="lion" /> main program (lion), call it twice like this: <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_run_1.png" alt="dinosaur" /> <img src="@source/en/guide/mods/vbots/vbots_number_2.png" alt="x2" /></p>

<p>You are born at a random location in the morning. This is when you need to look for trees. The sun will rise and set</p>
<div>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>If the creature/monster mod is enabled in this world, creatures will appear randomly in this world, and some unique creatures/monsters will only appear during the day or night, which will have a great impact on your survival.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="dig-and-get-falling-blocks" tabindex="-1"> Dig and get falling blocks</h2>
<p>The way to get resources in survival mode is by digging and getting dropped blocks.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/tree.jpg" alt="tree" /></p>
<p>A tree generally consists of a trunk and leaves. As shown, this is an apple tree, and the nearby lighter-colored trees are pine trees. The wood is all the same except for differences in color and grain.</p>
<p>Since you don't have any tools, you need to get close and aim at the wood (with a small crosshair), and hit the wood continuously, and you will find a block crack in the wood, keep hitting the wood, when the crack is full of this A block, this block will be dug up, appear on the ground in the form of an item, and will be picked up if approached (the <code>ItemDrop</code> module is enabled by default). Most blocks require specific tools to break quickly and drop.</p>
<div>
<p>How to "Hit Wood"</p>
<p>After approaching the tree:</p>

</div>
<p>In a few seconds you have an extra piece of wood in your hand</p>
<h2 id="combining-item-and-equipment" tabindex="-1"> Combining item and equipment</h2>
<p>Changing items or creating new items is achieved by placing different items in different positions in the synthesis column, which is called an item synthesis recipe.</p>
<p>Open the item bar, left-click the wood, and put it into any of the 6 (3x3) squares below the synthesis, and the synthesized item will appear in the small square on the right. Congratulations, you have decomposed the wood into 4 planks.
Then you can drag the wood plank synthesized in the small square on the right to your own inventory.</p>

<h3 id="stick" tabindex="-1"> Stick</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/tree_stick.jpg" alt="stick" /></p>
<p>Then put a piece of wood into the synthesis bar, you will get 4 sticks.</p>
<h3 id="pickaxe" tabindex="-1"> Pickaxe</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/pick_menu.jpg" alt="pick" /></p>
<p>Make a pickaxe in this way (you can do without any tools, but you must have a pickaxe). You can replace the pickaxe (three blocks of wood/stone horizontally is the pickaxe) with stone or iron ingot.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/dig_stone.jpg" alt="dig stone" /></p>
<p>Then go to dig the stone, the gray one is the stone, collect it with a pickaxe, and get the rough stone.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_pick.jpg" alt="stone pick" /></p>
<p>In this way, stone pickaxes can collect iron ore that wooden pickaxes cannot.</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_with_coal.jpg" alt="coal" /></p>
<p>The ones with black dots are coal mines, where coal can be dug out;</p>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_with_iron.jpg" alt="stone_with_iron.jpg" /></p>
<p>Iron ore is dotted with dark gold, and iron ore can be dug out.</p>
<h3 id="torch" tabindex="-1"> Torch</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/torch.jpg" alt="torch" /></p>
<p>A piece of coal and a stick are used as a torch for lighting.</p>
<h3 id="furnace" tabindex="-1"> Furnace</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/furnace.jpg" alt="furnace" /></p>
<p>Eight rough stones are used to build a furnace for cooking cooked food and minerals.</p>
<p>Put fuel under the furnace: coal, wood, leaves..., and put materials that need to be heated on it.</p>
<h3 id="iron-ingots" tabindex="-1"> Iron ingots</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/furnace_iron.jpg" alt="furnace iron" /></p>
<p>Coal, various leaves, and most wood products can be used as fuel, and fired items are placed on top, such as iron ore to obtain iron ingots.</p>
<p>In the early stage, there was no coal, so you could put leaves, planks and wooden tools into it as fuel to burn. Of course, the fire will go out after a while, because it is not resistant to burning, so you need to put more fuel.</p>
<h3 id="steel-pickaxe" tabindex="-1"> Steel Pickaxe</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/steel_pick.jpg" alt="steel_pick" /></p>
<p>If you make an iron pick as shown in the picture, you can collect more advanced minerals above iron ore.</p>
<h3 id="axe" tabindex="-1"> Axe</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_axe.jpg" alt="stone_axe" /></p>
<p>The method of an axe (stone can be replaced by wood, iron, etc., and other tools are the same) is mainly used for chopping wood products, and is also encouraged to be used as a weapon.</p>
<h3 id="sword" tabindex="-1"> Sword</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_sword.jpg" alt="stone_sword.jpg" /></p>
<p>The practice of the sword can cause a group injury effect of horizontal slashing on multiple targets.</p>
<h3 id="shovel" tabindex="-1"> Shovel</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_shovel.jpg" alt="stone_shovel.jpg" /></p>
<p>Shovels are used to dig dirt, sand, and gravel faster.</p>
<h3 id="hoe" tabindex="-1"> Hoe</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/stone_hoe.jpg" alt="stone_hoe.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hoe, used for farming, right click on the soil to generate arable land.</p>
<h3 id="bucket" tabindex="-1"> Bucket</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/steel_bucket.jpg" alt="steel_bucket.jpg" /></p>
<p>The iron bucket can lift water (press the left button to dig water where there is water). Use right button (place) to pour water.</p>
<h3 id="plant" tabindex="-1"> Plant</h3>
<p><img src="@source/en/guide/play/imgs/plant_water.jpg" alt="plant" /></p>
<p>Sow seeds on cultivated land (wheat seeds can be obtained by rolling grass), and there must be a water source next to the cultivated land to grow well.</p>

<li>️️🆕️️ Synchronized update to Minetest v5.7.0 game engine
<ul>
<li>🆕️️ New post-processing pipelines: Bloom and Dynamic Exposure
<ul>
<li>The post-processing pipeline refers to the process of performing some special effects on the entire picture after rendering the scene. These special effects can be to enhance the brightness, contrast, saturation, etc. of the picture, or to add some visual effects, such as floodlight, depth of field and more.</li>
<li>Dynamic Exposure (Dynamic Exposure) can simulate the adaptive adjustment of the eyes when entering the cave from a bright area, so as to achieve a high dynamic range (HDR) effect.</li>
<li><img src="@source/imgs/backroom_small.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Backrooms game with bloom shaders, taken by Extex (CC BY 4.0)" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhanced dynamic shadows</li>
<li>🆕️️ Optimized (improved) field of view for modern GPUs
<ul>

<ul>
<li>⛔️ Fix: <code>enable_damage</code> and <code>creative_mode</code> in the game world are invalid in headless server
<ul>
<li>Found that the code uses <code>g_settings</code> settings. It works in the client because it is saved to the configuration (<code>menu_worldmt_legacy</code>) every time you click the <code>enable_damage</code> setting.</li>
<li>This is a dilemma. If you sometimes want to enable <code>enable_damage</code> and <code>creative_mode</code>, then the global will be invalid, and you can only rely on the world configuration.</li>
<li>If there is a global configuration, follow the global configuration, otherwise see the world configuration</li>
<li>The current idea (not yet implemented) is that if there are mandatory settings in the game configuration, then the settings in the game configuration shall prevail, followed by the mandatory settings in the game world, and finally the mandatory settings in the global configuration</li>
<li>In principle, it is just a warning: if you enable mandatory settings upstream, problems may occur because the underlying game level does not support it, so it is best for ordinary users not to enable mandatory settings.</li>
<li>The priority is system default configuration &lt; game configuration &lt; game world configuration &lt; global configuration (the same is true for the priority of mandatory settings)
<ul>
<li>Normal setting &lt; Mandatory setting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>🆕️️ When creating a new game world in the <code>minetest-game</code> game, the default function mod is automatically enabled.</li>
<li>Enhanced <code>quiz</code> function module:
<ul>
<li>⛔️ Fix settings: all configurations of <code>bool</code> type cannot be set</li>
<li>⛔️ Fix settings: Chat command <code>/answer</code> doesn't work</li>
<li>🆕️️ Added <code>forceAdminQuiz</code> setting: Whether to force the administrator to answer the challenge, the default is true.</li>
<li>🆕️️ Added <code>immediateQuiz</code> setting: Whether to ask to answer the challenge immediately after entering the game. Defaults to true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>⛔️ Fix (Android): &quot;Allow remote game&quot;, &quot;Allow local game&quot;, teacher password, student password and other settings cannot be saved</li>
<li>🆕️️ The game world can have its own static spawn-point.
<ul>
<li>Need to load world.mt somewhere and then merge into <code>g_settings</code>, that is to say, the configuration priority is world.mt &gt; minetest.conf</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>🆕️️ Added feature mod (minetest_game) &quot;basic&quot; materials and items: basic_materials

<li>This mod provides a small set of &quot;basic&quot; materials and items that other mods should use where possible: such as steel bars and chains, wires, plastic strips and sheets, etc. The idea is to remove duplication from mod to mod and reduce recipe conflicts.</li>

<li>🆕️️Enhancement mods that are enabled by default can be turned off in the world configuration
<ul>
<li>If you have already installed the old version, you may need to manually enable the default functional modules in the world configuration after installing the new version.</li>
<li>If you don't want to enable it manually, you can delete the existing <strong>default</strong> world, and then restart the software (it will automatically rebuild the <strong>default</strong> world).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The current default function modules are as follows:

<p>The concept of &quot;<a href="https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/voxel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voxel</a>&quot; in <a href="https://minetest.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minetest</a> is similar to building blocks like Lego. In the interactive world, players can use these blocks to create houses, tools, and more. Unlike expensive Lego bricks, players can explore the virtual worlds they create and experience the new environments they design using these building blocks.</p>

<details><summary>Experience the "new world" you create</summary>
<p>The interactive world of Minetest allows for the use of material blocks to build a wide variety of creative structures, from houses and farms to cities and tools. Players can mine and sculpt metal ore into ingots, then use those ingots to create different types of tools and structures. Unlike expensive Lego bricks, players can explore and experience their creations in a virtual world. For example, players can use ladders, make glass blocks from sand, and watch the square sun rise from their porch.</p>

<details><summary>Letting children play in the interactive educational world does not serve any educational purpose.</summary>
<p>Even in an interactive educational world, children may avoid completing tasks and instead engage in meaningless play if there is no adult supervision or guidance: jumping from a high place to commit suicide (the child calls it bungee jumping), after being resurrected, and running away again... It can be a joy to play.</p>
</details>
<p>Parents/teachers can manage game content, control playtime, and have educational exercises periodically appear during gameplay to enhance learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="task-item-0" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /><label for="task-item-0"> Separates game interface into gameplay and password-protected content management screens for parents/teachers.</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="task-item-1" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /><label for="task-item-1"> Control of gameplay time to protect children's eyesight</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="task-item-2" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /><label for="task-item-2"> Periodically presents educational exercises to improve knowledge while playing</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="task-item-3" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" /><label for="task-item-3"> Single-player game support different users to use a shared computer</label></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" id="task-item-4" disabled="disabled" /><label for="task-item-4"> Write interactive educational world courses using approximate natural language text outside of the game(to be implemented)</label></li>
</ul>
<p>To enhance the learning experience, we developed the <a href="/en/guide/mods/quiz/">Quiz player challenge mod</a> to implement periodic exercises during gameplay, ensuring that children are consistently practicing and learning.</p>
<p>To make it easier for parents and teachers to manage game content, we directly modified the interface of Minetest by separating the student game interface (gameplay) from the teacher interface (manage game content). This makes it easier for teachers to manage the game and customize it for their students.</p>
<p>In addition, Minetest: Education Edition comes with a variety of built-in educational mods, including mods for mathematics, automation, electronic circuits, programming, and more. These mods provide a wealth of educational content that can be used to enhance learning in various subjects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we plan to develop a specification for a near-natural language text format, which will be used to write interactive course content. The course content written in this format can be converted into Minetest game worlds using a tool that we'll develop. This means that teachers will only need to maintain the course content text, rather than the game world itself.</p>
<p>This approach will make it easier for teachers and parents to collaborate on course content, as they can review and revise the text-based course content without having to deal with the complexities of building and maintaining a game world.</p>
<p>The game world is engaging and encourages children to keep practicing if they want to continue playing. With <a href="/en/guide/get-started/">Minetest: Education Edition</a>, children can explore and learn in a fun and interactive way, with the freedom to customize their learning experience to fit their interests and needs.</p>
<p>We hope that by releasing this open-source project, more people can benefit from the learning opportunities presented by <a href="/en/guide/get-started/">Minetest: Education Edition</a>.</p>
